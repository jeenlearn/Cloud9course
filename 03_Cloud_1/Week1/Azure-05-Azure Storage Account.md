# Azure Storage Account

The Azure Storage platform is Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage offers highly available, massively scalable, durable, and secure storage for a variety of data objects in the cloud. 

## Key Terminologies

* Blob : Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

## Exercise 1
- Create an Azure Storage Account. Make sure only you have access to the data.
- Place data in a storage service of your choice via the console (for example, a cat picture in Blob storage).
- Retrieve the data to your own computer using the Azure Storage Explorer.
