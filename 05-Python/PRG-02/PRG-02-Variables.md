# Variables
 A variable can store a value. This value can then be accessed with the variable name in the code. This is useful if you want to use one value multiple times, or if you want to dynamically change the value.


## Key Terminologies

* Variables: Variables are containers for storing data values.A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes.Variable names are case-sensitive.



## Exercise 1

Create a new script.
Create two variables x and y. Assign a numerical value to both variables.
Print the values of x and y.
Create a third variable named z. The value of z should be the sum of x and y.
Print the value of z.

### Overcome challenges
 No challenges faced.

 ### Results

Two variables are assigned with values and their sum calculated and printed int he terminal.

## Exercise 2

Create a new script.
Create a variable name. The value of name should be your name.
Print the text “Hello, <your name here>!”. Use name in the print statement.

 ### Results

 Printing your name from the variable along with a message on the terminal.

## Exercise 3

Create a new script.
Create a variable and assign a value to it.
Print the text “Value 1: <value 1 here>”.
Change the value of that same variable.
Print the text “Value 2: <value 2 here>”.
Change the value of that same variable.
Print the text “Value 3: <value 3 here>”.

### Overcome challenges
 No challenges faced.

 ### Results

 Variable names in Python are case sensitive. The String variables can be declared in double or single quotes. The value of the variables changes when you reassign . See the screen shot below:
